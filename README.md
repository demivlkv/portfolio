# Personal Portfolio
This particular project is of upmost importance to me. It is intended to display my understanding of creating a functional web application utilizing HTML and CSS - particularly flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. It had been designed to be a personal showcase for my web applications. This portfolio will be a continuous work-in-progress in an effort to effectively present my progress and skills as an aspiring web developer to potential employers.
